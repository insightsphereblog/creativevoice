            Why You Need a Gas Safe Registered Engineer
          </h2>
          <p>
            Only Gas Safe Registered engineers are legally allowed to work on
            gas appliances in the UK. Using someone who isn‚Äôt registered isn‚Äôt
            just illegal ‚Äî it could be dangerous.
          </p>
          <p>
            All engineers at TPA Emergency Repairs are fully registered,
            experienced, and up to date with the latest safety standards. We
            carry out all work to the highest level of compliance and are happy
            to show our Gas Safe ID cards on arrival.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it‚Äôs a small job like reconnecting a cooker or a full
            heating system overhaul, our priority is always your safety and
            comfort.
